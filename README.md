The lab I did this week was about how to setup your computer for ssh and docker. 
The instructions on this lab was pretty straightforward and had no problem with the lab.
The commands to setup ssh were there and had no difficulties setting it up.
To install Docker, i followed the instructions that were given in the lab instructions and was able to install it without anyother resorce.
